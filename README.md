Wheel
=====

Wheel is a small php framework to demonstrate ideas used in other frameworks such as Zend and Symfony, hopefully simplifying the ideas enough that they are easy to reverse engineer and play with.

The project also keeps me busy, as i need to keep new ideas simple and easy to pickup. 


Starting up
===========
More recent versions of PHP come with a basic webserver included, Wheel plays nicely with this. Getting it up and running is really straight forward

```bash
cd /path/to/your/copy;
php -S 0.0.0.0:80 -t web
```
